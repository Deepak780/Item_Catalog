# Item_Catalog

### Overview
In this project, we will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.
A user need not logged in, in order to read the categories pr items. However, users who are created an item or category will be able to update the data.
It also uses a user authentication like third party auth Google or Facebook.

### What you will learn?
You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. You will then learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
